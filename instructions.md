# Instructions to Add Clubs

## Step 1: Find a Club to Add

Check the responses spreadsheet for a club that hasn't been added. Check off the checkbox under "started" column to reserve a club. Once you finish step 1 and 2 below, you can check it off in the "finished" column.

## Step 2: Add the Club

Add the club information to the array in `clubList.js` file

```javascript
